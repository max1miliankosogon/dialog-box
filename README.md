# dialog-box
In this project, using HTML, CSS and Angular, I developed dialog forms.

Tasks for this project:
1. Using the controller and ng-model directives, develop a dialog form
2. Provide verification (validation) of the state of the developed form and all its control elements using their properties and CSS classes.
